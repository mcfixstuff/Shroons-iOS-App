IF THIS APP REFUSES TO LOAD SHOWS OR ANYTHING FROM THE API, PLEASE DO NOT FAIL ME!!!!!
MY WEB SERVER THAT I HOST FROM MY OWN HOME ON MY OWN INTERNET IS AN OLD LENOVO DESKTOP TOWER RUNNING LINUX
THE WEBSERVER FRAMEWORK IS DJANGO, AND IT IS OFTEN INTENTIONALLY CRASHED BY BOTS DESPITE MY ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE IT
IT IS SET TO SOFT REBOOT THE WEB SERVER EVERY 6 HOURS TO TRY TO MAINTAIN SERVICE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
TRY AGAIN LATER, AND IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK, PLEASE EMAIL ME @ eric@shroons.com TO HARD REBOOT THE SERVER.
